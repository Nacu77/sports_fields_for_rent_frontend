        We got you covered. Here you can register any fields you have, set a schedule, then others can easily rent them. You don't even need to
        interact with the people. It's so easy.

        We have a solution for that too. After you rented a field, you can do a public post so others can also join and have fun with you. Set a limit
        of people that can join and then just wait for them to apply.
